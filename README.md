# Arcy
Arcy is an app that I developed to understand threads and connectivity between android devices.
It allows one device to be a server and other devices to be the clients.It can hold up to five clients.
* Clients can subscribe and unsubscribe to channels.
* Clients can choose their nickname to be displayed in the chatRooms.
* Clients can view who is currently in the chatRoom.
* Clients can send private messages to ceach other. 
* Commands are:
  1. "/join" joins a channe;
  2. "/nick" choose your nickname
  3. "/list" list people in the channel
  4. "/leave"leave channel
  5. "/msg"  send private message
  7. "/quit" quit server
